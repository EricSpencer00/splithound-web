      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>SplitHound is an application that assists with receipt scanning and simple bill-splitting workflows. We intentionally minimize collection of personal data.</p>

      <h3>Data we do not collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or payment credentials as part of the core app functionality.</li>
        <li>Image processing (OCR) and model inference is performed on-device wherever possible; we do not send raw receipt images to our servers.</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>No server-side processing</h3>
  <p>This application is a frontend (on-device) tool. OCR, image processing, and model inference are performed on the user's device. We do not transmit receipt images, OCR output, or other user data to any server operated by the provider as part of normal app operation.</p>

  <h3>Analytics & purchases</h3>
  <p>We do not collect analytics or purchase data on our servers. Any in-app purchases are processed by the platform (for example, the Apple App Store or Google Play). The provider does not retain receipt images or raw OCR data on a server. The app developer may receive standard reporting from the app store (sales totals, aggregated reports) which are not tied to personal identifiers by the provider.</p>

  <h3>Crash reports and logs</h3>
  <p>The App does not send crash reports or error logs to the provider by default. If you enable optional crash reporting or diagnostics within the app (for example, via a setting), that data may be transmitted to a third-party crash-reporting provider; in that case the provider will disclose the provider name and the data transmitted and provide an option to opt out.</p>

  <h3>Local storage and cookies</h3>
  <p>The App stores data locally on your device (including drafts, parsed receipt data, and settings). If the App includes a web component, that component may use local storage or cookies within the webview. Local storage data remains on your device unless you explicitly export or sync it.</p>

  <h3>Contacts and syncing</h3>
  <p>The App may offer an optional feature to import or sync contacts from your device to make splitting bills easier (for example, assigning line items to people). This is an opt-in feature: the App will request the appropriate system permissions before accessing contacts. Any contacts imported for use in the App are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to or retained by the Provider's servers as part of normal operation.</p>

  <p>If you explicitly export contacts or sync them to a third-party service (for example, to a cloud backup or an external integration), that export is performed by you and is outside the control of the Provider. Please ensure you have permission to export or share contact information and consult any applicable privacy rules in your jurisdiction.</p>

      <h3>Retention and security</h3>
      <p>Local drafts and receipt data are stored on the user's device unless the user explicitly exports or syncs them. We recommend users review and delete any sensitive content before sharing. We take reasonable technical measures to secure any server-side aggregated data but cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h3>GDPR and similar laws</h3>
  <p>This application is designed to avoid collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and to perform processing on-device. If you export, sync, or otherwise send data to third-party services, you are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws such as GDPR. This privacy policy does not constitute legal advice. If you operate in the EU or process EU personal data, consult legal counsel to confirm compliance obligations.</p>

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>If you have questions, contact the operator at the address or email listed in the app store listing.</p>

  <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If material changes occur, we will update the "Last updated" date and notify users through the app store release notes.</p>
